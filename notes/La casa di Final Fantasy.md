# La Casa di Final Fantasy

Tra le prime storie di Internet, ce ne sono poche famigerate come la casa di Final Fantasy. 
Sebbene i dettagli non siano chiari alla maggior parte di coloro che la ricordano, la sua reputazione è ancora oggi invocata sui forum in riferimento a terribili coinquilini o al potenziale eccentrico delle comunità online, in particolare dei fandom. 

Inoltre, è stato uno dei canali principali attraverso cui gli utenti di Internet sono stati introdotti al fenomeno dell'altro genere. 
Che cos'era la Final Fantasy House? 
Il 18 aprile 2005, un utente di Livejournal, sotto il nome di Genki Crock, ha pubblicato un lungo post che descriveva un'esperienza con alcuni fan di Final Fantasy 7, un popolare e influente gioco giapponese basato sulla storia.

L'ha introdotta scrivendo: "Queste persone sono pericolose Questo non è uno scherzo. Questa è la mia esperienza con loro". Ha iniziato spiegando il suo posto all'interno del fandom.

Quote, 
> "La maggior parte delle persone che guardano il blog ora probabilmente non lo sanno. Ma ai tempi gestivo un sito web piuttosto popolare dedicato ai personaggi cloud e al personaggio minore Zach. Da Final Fantasy 7. Era davvero l'unico sito completo su questi due personaggi, e per questo fu molto apprezzato. Ero abituato a ricevere le mail dei fan o le fan art di altre persone, che mettevo sul sito". 

All'epoca della sua presunta esperienza, ha spiegato di essere una matricola del college e un forte bevitore. Nel 2002 è stato contattato da una persona che si faceva chiamare Hojo, in riferimento al cattivo scienziato pazzo del gioco, e i due hanno iniziato a conversare occasionalmente su AOL instant messenger.

Hojo aveva un proprio sito di fan dedicato al suo omonimo e, seguendo lo stesso schema, iniziò a chiamare lo scrittore Zach dopo il suo sito, che all'epoca non pensava a nulla. Qualche tempo dopo gli fu presentata la moglie di Hojo, che si faceva chiamare Jenova o Jen, come un'antica creatura aliena e malvagia del gioco. Lo scrittore descrive il loro primo incontro online, cito: 

> "Poi è arrivata una bella notizia bomba. Mi è stato chiesto se avessi qualche ricordo di vite passate, io credo nelle vite passate. Penso che sia un ciclo abbastanza valido, visto che molte culture ci credono. Così le ho detto che no, non ci credevo, ma che ci credevo. Non avrei mai dovuto dirlo. Era come invitare il vampiro a casa mia. L'attacco di Gens fu rapido, ne sono certo. Cominciò a spiegarmi a raffica che esistevano universi alternativi. Mi concedete che è sicuro che possano esistere? E in quegli universi, forse, solo forse, i videogiochi esistono davvero. Ho pensato che potesse essere plausibile perché mi piace immaginare che tutto sia possibile. In tutto questo trambusto, lei mi dice che secondo lei, in una vita passata, io ero Zach di Final Fantasy 7. Pensateci, ha detto, siete entrambi cresciuti in campagna, avete entrambi l'istinto di trascinare tutti gli amici che potrebbero essere lasciati indietro. Ti prendi una pallottola per qualcuno, giusto? Tu dici di non credere nella magia o in altre cose del genere e lui voleva essere un mercenario. Per tutte le sue 5 o 6 righe, hai un modo di parlare simile. Vivi anche in uno scantinato, come lui era rinchiuso nel primo, e lo odi. Aggiungi il tuo cervello con l'idiozia della matricola e la vodka e tutto questo avrà improvvisamente un senso. Certo. Forse ora non sono lui, ho detto, ma era possibile..."

Zach accettò di incontrarli nella città di State College, in Pennsylvania, quell'inverno, per rimanere in un appartamento una settimana prima di Natale. 
Alla fermata dell'autobus fu accolto da Hojo, che indossava un camice da laboratorio e che lo scortò fino al luogo in cui vivevano. 

>"Quando arrivammo all'appartamento, Jen, che insisteva perché la chiamassi Jenova e si riferiva spesso a se stessa come Jenny Nova, si avvicinò a Hojo e a me urlando in faccia a Hojo. Non ho idea del motivo. Indossava una gonna viola tirata su intorno al seno. Sembrava che si fosse appena alzata dal letto e io ero a dir poco intimorito. Circa tre secondi dopo, si girò di scatto, diventando improvvisamente la persona più gentile del mondo, e qualsiasi cosa la facesse arrabbiare era fuori dalla finestra. In quel momento, però, ho iniziato a capire che Jen non stava giocando di ruolo quando parlava dei suoi figli e degli altri sé. Jen è ciò che internet chiama "soul bonder" o, in altre parole, "bat-shit looney". Crede di avere molte persone che vivono nella sua testa e che parlano. E quando vuole assumere una personalità che meglio si adatta a una situazione per il suo tornaconto personale, la mette in scena. Per esempio, se volesse ottenere compassione, alzerebbe l'immagine della sua voce e fingerebbe di essere un bambino innocente.".

Nonostante questi eventi, l'esperienza complessiva dello scrittore è stata positiva ed è tornato spesso in visita, pagando ogni volta 300 dollari per il biglietto dell'autobus. 
A ogni visita, incontrava qualcuno di nuovo, molti dei quali erano loro stessi soul-bonders. Jen chiedeva spesso soldi per comprare il cibo e lo scrittore cedeva sentendosi in obbligo. La scrittrice cercava anche di aiutare lo scrittore e gli altri a prendere sempre più confidenza con il personaggio della fantasia finale che aveva assegnato loro. 

Ciò avveniva con vari mezzi, tra cui la pantomima di battaglie magiche e una regressione della vita passata che prevedeva di sdraiarsi sul pavimento e ascoltare la musica del gioco. In un caso, durante un viaggio al college, lei e Hojo hanno chiuso lo scrittore in una stanza insonorizzata fino al punto di panico per aiutarlo a "ricordare di essere Zach".

Un'altra volta, incontrando una persona legata all'anima del personaggio Eris, Jen ha tentato di convincerla ad andare a letto insieme. A tal fine, annunciò che avrebbe sprecato il loro cibo con degli afrodisiaci. Ma, che l'abbia fatto davvero o meno, le sue richieste non si sono realizzate. 

Per quanto strani fossero questi episodi, tuttavia, non furono sufficienti a dissuadere lo scrittore quando Jen e Hojo gli proposero di trasferirsi da loro. Lo scrittore si trasferì nell'appartamento del college statale nell'estate del 2003 con l'intenzione di rimanere solo per la stagione. Nel giro di tre giorni trovò un lavoro part-time in un supermercato per pagare il cibo e l'affitto, e smise anche di bere. Ma la sua esperienza si è rapidamente degradata, cito:

>"Non so nemmeno dire cosa sia venuto prima, l'uovo o la gallina, ma diciamo che dopo una settimana mi ero stufata. Ero il cavallo di battaglia. Forse perché ero uno Zach e quindi ero l'uomo virile al contrario di Jen, la regina della tetra, o di Hojo, il fragile scienziato. Jen aveva lasciato il suo lavoro di baby sitter e si rifiutava di cercarne un altro. Io ero quello che doveva portare la spesa da e per la casa, quello che guadagnava i soldi per sfamare tutti. Quella che doveva aggiustare o spostare i mobili quando era necessario farlo. Il mio computer si connetteva raramente perché Jen era attiva quasi 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7. Il resto del tempo lo passava a guardare. Il resto del tempo mi osservava mentre scrivevo, così non potevo mai scrivere un articolo di diario che recitasse qualcosa del genere. Jen sta abusando di me, aiutami Dio, sono stanco e voglio andarmene da qui."

Il modello di sorveglianza di Jen peggiorò rapidamente. Ascoltava sempre le telefonate, leggeva le sue interazioni online e pretendeva di sapere dove andava per tenerlo sotto controllo, lo svegliava spesso nel cuore della notte per varie commissioni magiche, privandolo del sonno. Pretendeva che lui spendesse il suo misero stipendio in puntate da 10 dollari per cena, cosa che lo faceva star male. E quando questi ultimi duravano solo una notte, lei e Hojo gli facevano chiedere il cibo invenduto al supermercato. 
Nessuno nell'appartamento portava fuori la spazzatura o faceva le pulizie, a parte lo scrittore che lavava solo i piatti. 
E così la puzza si diffuse nell'appartamento nella calda estate della Pennsylvania. Jen indossava un solo vestito e si rifiutava di fare il bagno, scegliendo invece di usare un olio profumato.
La scrittrice ha descritto l'odore dell'appartamento come carne in decomposizione e un miasma di sporcizia con un profumo di zuccheri artificiali spruzzato sopra. Inoltre, Jen e Hojo si picchiavano ad alta voce e con frequenza crescente dietro la porta del tamburo, mentre l'estate continuava a essere seguita da sesso rumoroso. 

Questo schema di fame, privazione del sonno, sorveglianza e isolamento sociale erose la volontà dello scrittore, che iniziò a sostenerli ciecamente. Ad esempio, mentre lo scrittore si trovava lì, Eris si stancò di Jen ed ebbero un litigio. 

>"Apparently, Eris called 1 evening when Hojo and I were at the used bookstore stealing books. Yes, that poor and said she wanted some of her things back that she had left at the apartment. Jen exploded. She called Hojo's cell phone in tears, screaming she was going to kill herself. I believed it. Hojo called Sid and demanded he go over. Hojo called Eris and screamed at her. I told her off too. We rented a taxi with money we didn't have and raced home. Jen who had been screaming shit that her wrists was sitting in the middle of the floor Sid was raping damp clothes on her wrists. I woke up for a second and knew this was bullshit. I had a problem with self injury, so I knew very well the sight of a deep cut and the sight of a light cut. I know well knife wounds. Jen had scratched herself horizontally on the wrists Maybe it had been with a safety pin or a butter knife. It was not any kind of suicide attempt. At the most, it would sting. But I was still mad at Arris because I was supposed to be I wrote her nasty emails. I joined them in bashing her. I ignored her when she came to pick up her stuff even though she obviously wanted to still be friends with me. I regret that now because we never reconciled then. Maybe if I had got a clue and tried to get out with her, things would have turned out different."

Soon, he was left with no money to leave and no confidence to ask for help. 
Even when he attempted to talk to his father at a pay phone, Jen would go hunting for him. 
Then when the filth in the apartment grew unbearable, Jen and Hojo asked their landlord if they could move to a smaller single room apartment. Further increasing their proximity, the writer was the one to move the boxes.

Soon after the move, the supermarket cut the writer's job to 1 hour a week. 
But even so, Hojo took all of them out to buy new things for the apartment, implying that she had been hiding money away in order to make the writer pay for things. Here as they did many other times, they fought publicly. 

However, there was one person from the circle of friends in town who had consistently helped to stabilize the writer's mental state, a person who went by Cid, also a name from Final fantasy, though the author describes him as having, quote, "one foot in reality". 

He wrote 
> "Cid occasionally would come over. When he did, I was glad because it was someone else. But he was and still does have his dickish moments. Jen would make these the all end all and Renee would back her up.  I began to he was like that all the time and didn't want to hang out with him when he was gone.  Once he came back, they had to restart the process of brainwashing me all over again." 

It was after one of these visits that the writer finally gathered the will to leave, inspired after someone had stolen his shoes he left everything behind in the apartment and walked the street's barefoot. 

By the end, he had spent a total of 2 months living with Jen and Hojo after being homeless for few days, Cid helped him gather his things and returned to his mother's home in Brooklyn. 
Besides his own account, the writer spoke of a few others involved with Jen specifically. 
One account was about someone he referred to as Captain McCool, a sensitive person with whom they sought to fill the vacant spot that the writer had left.

When they asked him to move in with them, he was too nervous to turn them down directly, and so he claimed that he had been assault to avoid it. When they discovered his lie, they, quote, 
> "had him stuck in a chair and forced him to watch while they raped each other". 

Another person whom he referred to as Bean would sell her blood to help fund Jen's lifestyle. At the time he was writing the live journal post, she was still living with them but stayed in the attic and was forced to remain as quiet as possible. 
The writer expected some people in the final fantasy community to see this, but he couldn't expect the sort of attention it would receive. Words spread quickly about the live journal and many fans of Final Fantasy as well as Soul Bonders commented that they had heard some details about Jen and the group in state college, but hadn't known the extent of their behavior. 

Others who already knew her found these claims unsurprising. Beyond the community, however, this story gained interest on forums, including 4chan who treated it with disgust and fascination. It was soon adopted into general knowledge as a way to reference poor living conditions and soul bonders, a subsection of a group known as Otherkin. 

It was here that the infamous story earned its generally recognized name and misonomer "the final fantasy 7 house" or often just "the final fantasy house". Though the rest of the Internet would sometimes question its veracity, the writer's account seemed generally accepted within the final fantasy community. 

He began to receive testimony from other people affected by the group, many of them people he had met during his time at the apartment. To share their correspondences, he created a website where he cataloged the accounts of those who approached him alongside his own. Due to the limited archival information available, it's difficult to say the rate at which he updated the site with new accounts, but it appears he was receiving them as late as 2006, with each person represented by a pseudo NIM. 

Some of these accounts were from people mentioned in the original life journal post and they helped elucidate the practices of the group and enunciate Gens and Hojo's behaviors. These accounts suggest an era of amateurishness, yet charisma to everything Jen did. For example, one account from someone going by Zarla wrote, quote, 

> "There were also tarot card readings and such while we were there. Jen had the same tarot deck I had as a kid, the tarot of the cap people, and she told my fortune using the exact same method outlined in the little booklet that came with the cards. I can't remember anything really specific about the readings except there was always mention of something coming after me or something. Thus, the coughing. If I remember right, later we were playing with the Ouija board and that something or someone was again trying to contact us."

These accounts would also unanimously support the assertions about Jen from the original writer. One of the oddest entries, however, was an open letter prefaced by the live journal writer, quote, 

"the following was taken from the wayback machine. It is posted without consent of the original author and I want to make that damn clear. She has nothing to do with it being here, so don't involve her. It is being backed up here due to the fact that it contains some current information that I felt should be edited out, like names or references to other people uninvolved. As far as I know, the original author is now happily farming turkeys in Idaho. Don't hassle her. This was written in 2003. 

The article itself is apparently written by another active member of the soul bonding community, though clearly no longer associated with Jen under the pseudonym CandyWrapper. The introduction to the letter reads, Jenova, when I became your apprentice, you told me to shut up and not argue with you. Apparently, a sorceress is supposed to be creature who blindly accepts the opinions of the authorities even when she firmly believes that they are wrong. From this, I learned that when Jen says something I disagree with, I need to nod and make agreeing sounds anyway. Otherwise, we would have to fight every two minutes and quite frankly, saying what I thought wasn't worth the hassle. I am not, however, your apprentice anymore, and I am free to say what I think. And I will because it's a relief to say it even if you aren't reading this. I do not actually give a crap whether you read it or not. It will hurt your feelings and you will care that it happened and I don't. You have been warned. The letter is structured as a list and the first item reveals the name of Jen. You do not look like any final fantasy characters. You look like Jennifer Cornett, End of Story. 

She shared some of her thoughts on Hojo and her relationship with Jen.

> If Renee does not go to class and do her homework, it will be difficult for her to pass those classes. Then she is no closer to graduating. Until she graduates, it will be hard for her to get a job that makes more money than she gets now. This is called capitalism and it's a bitch. No one likes it, but no 1 has come up with anything that works any better. Rene always has to call off work or skip class to give you attention. She does this because she loves you. Love makes people do irrational and reckless things. This is one of them. That does not make it a good idea. You are wrecking Renee's life. It is wrong to do so even if you have her permission. A few other choice lines read, you have no money because you keep spending it on things you want. Anything you want is not automatically a magical item. There may be potential magic in everything, but then there's magic in things you don't bother to look at. Things you can have for free. If something is a magical item, that doesn't mean you must own it. It would be nice if you could but you can't always do so. I had money because I rarely bought anything for myself. Whenever I got some money, I would save it. I am not a money generator and neither are my parents. If you want to have money, you need to not spend it. I now do not have money because I spent it on you. Poof, all gone. You still wanted more, but I didn't have any more to give you. I have been using crystals since I was 10 years old. You are wrong when you start with that, you won't use them properly shit because I've been using crystals since elementary school. You taught me no magic. The only thing I actually learned from you was to beware of people like you. 

But among these accounts, there was one that stood out from the others, and if it's to be believed, it showed just how far the manipulation of Jen's entourage could go. 
In November of 2005, the life journal writer entered email correspondence with a woman who went by Maila. Maila had apparently known and bonded with Jen in a Utah boarding school and rediscount covered her online through an open letter. 
Though the quote in the email isn't quite the same, it's highly likely that the letter Mela discovered was the list written by Candy wrapper. Hoping to reconnect, Ella asked the author of the letter for Jen's information and sometime after she visited Jen's residence for two weeks. Here she claims Jen was able to convince her to spend 2000 dollars on various objects and food by asking only for small amounts at a time. Sometime afterward, likely in 2005, Mila made the decision to begin living with them. Quote, 

> "I moved in with 17000 dollars in my bank account and soon Jen had drained all of that on necessities all for the house, many of which went into Jen's room and never came out Sooner received a check from the investment company for 80000 dollars and Jen's spending began again in earnest. I tried to get her to stop spending money on frivolous things but every time I said no or told her she should spend her own money buying things for herself, she threw a fit. All this time, she was telling me how important I was to a special plan, how the world needed us to stick together so we could conquer evil, etcetera. I wanted desperately to feel special. I was scared and alone and I believed her. She knew a few magic tricks was very good at reading people and could give relatively accurate tarot readings. I fell for her lies, hook, line, and sinker. 

After she moved in, it was clear that Hojo's relationship with Jen had deteriorated, and she had been supplanted by a new person named Angel, who Mel claimed was remarkably violent. 
Jen was now sleeping exclusively with Angel, though sometimes Hojo would sleep with Angel as well. Hojo was forced to stay extremely silent during the day or risk being berated by Jen. This information strongly suggests that Hojo was the one who was selling blood to fund Jen. Their hygiene was also still abysmal. 

> "Oh, how Jen smelled? Angel was much worse though. I don't think that girl ever bathed. They just kept adding perfume and Jen's purple skirt slash dress. Stinked to high heaven. That was until I made her other clothes to wear. 

Jen during this time was apparently made aware of the Live Journal writer's website as well. At some point, it appears that they moved somewhere new and it was here that she claimed she was beaten on multiple occasions. 
Once during a dispute, one of them grabbed onto Mala's hair and started slamming her head into the floor while Jen and Angel beat her with their fist. Then sat on her and attempted to choke her. Finally, she passed out from the head trauma. 

Jen would later convince her that she had attacked Jen first, then blacked out. Eventually, Mala would tolerate no more and she kicked them out. Much like their apartment, the house was left a mess. Which Mala documented with photographs. They also had stolen numerous objects upon their departure, including board games, fabric, and a set of corsets though her demand for back payments of rent, quote, in excess of 10k, is suspiciously inexact.

While this account is consistent with other reports of the group behavior, there was no method by which anyone could verify the veracity of any of them, instead leaving only the word of the writers. 
Alongside this, the author would finally reveal the faces of Jen and Hojo. 
In the frequently asked questions section, he wrote

>"Is this photo Vincent slash Jen slash Hojo? 90 percent of the time, no. This was Jen in 1999. She got fatter and dirtier. This was Rene in 2000. She looks the same."" 

In response to this attention, Jen and Hojo began to frantically delete most traces of themselves online and even with their names publicly available, nobody could find them. 
After this, the attention on these stories began to wane. 

But only a few years after the accounts were posted, the final fantasy house would return in a way that nobody expected and at first seemed entirely unrelated. 
On 07/15/2008, a live journal user by the name of DragonTigerClaw wrote a post entitled "Insane Housemate Part 1" and published it on "Housematehorror", an open moderated page where people could share their stories of bad roommates. 
The opening reads, quote, 

>I used to live in an awesome situation in SoCal until the house made from hell moved in. Fortunately, she has left, but the bitterness remains on my tongue. It is a saga that can only be told in pieces. Please bear with me. In the cut, you will find part 1 of the saga involving the girl who believed she was a video game character.

Soon, the author would name himself as Pete. The tale was structured in a regularly sized sections with many of them ending on cliffhangers. He explained that he was living with 5 other people in a 4 story house. 
He claimed that the rent was a preposterously low 500 dollars a month and that the landlord, Matt, kept it that way because his chief concern was that he wanted company in the house he had inherited. 
However, his standards for roommates were high. They all had to have stable income and employment and be at least 25 years old. 

The woman who was chosen after their screening process was kept anonymous by DragonTigerclaw and was given the placeholder name, Sara, who moved in without much trouble. She claimed to be a 27 year old computer programmer who already had a job in the area, but when she went back to work after the move, she returned, saying she was laid off. When others offered to help her find new work, she consistently delayed accepting it, which made them suspicious, but much more striking was her connection to a particular game. 

Quote, 
> "In the 3 weeks that followed, Sarah was still unemployed. She spent all her time playing video games in the family room, she would play the same game over and over, some crappy looking RPG from the nineties. Had an unpronounceable name, but Sarah said she was bonded to the game. She also told us that she changed her name to be that of one of the game characters. Upon further discussion, she explained that she believed she was the human incarnation of this character and that they shared a soul."

Dragon refused to reveal what characters she was claiming to be, however, since it would be identifying information. This game would, in the second update, be revealed to be the Japanese RPG, Suikoden released in 1995.

Soon afterwards, a friend of hers came to visit the house. She also believed herself bonded to a Suikoden character specifically Sasarai, but since Pete could neither spell nor pronounce it, he simply called her something. After spending a week together playing video games they picketed a barbecue that the rest of the housemates were having, though they had been given vegetarian options to join, they refused on moral grounds, denouncing them for eating meat. 

After they were aggressively told off, they were asked for a house meeting which took place in March to discuss whether or not Sarah would be allowed to stay. Sarah attempted to explain herself. 

Quote, 
>"Sarah lifted her head and started to talk. She started with I am sorry, but you have to understand where I am coming from. She also said, lots of people can't understand me because I have such a high intellect it is beyond their grasp. Excuse us for being sane, bitch.

They eventually learned that she had used friends help to get past the screening process. 
She had never had a job in California, was from the East Coast, and used a friend's address to get a California driver's license while another posed as her boss. 
Matt allowed her to stay until May first since she had already paid for April. Sarah, however, wasn't willing to leave so easily. By this point, numerous readers had become enraptured, begging for updates to what they had come to call the Sarah Saga and many returned daily in hopes that a new part would be posted by Keith. In response to the pressure from Matt and the rest of the house, Sarah isolated herself in her room with Sasarai acting as a go between, she would only leave it in Sasarai's company. 

However, this didn't last long as Matt was able to pull a favor from a psychologist friend to get her treatment for free and he managed to convince Sarah to attend soon she was on medication and was interacting with the others on a more normal basis. It was during this time that they discovered Sarah's true form of income. 

> "Plaintiffs can be, I have people offer me donations on my blog, so I can spread the news of my religion, her religion being that she is actually a male video game character from a game that came out in the nineties. What? So there are some morons out there who are giving money to Sarah so she can pretend to be a video game character and teach others how to do the same. Something said, we give her things because she has helped us find our true selves. So you don't work either, Tim asked. I could tell he was ready to explode. No, I get government benefits in the UK. Why? Because I don't like to work.

Soon after this, Sara's boyfriend convinced her to abandon her medication and the results were violent. After one of the housemates demanded she start taking the pills again, she began smashing fragile objects, including a window. She would continue to take her pills irregularly, but by this point interaction between her and the rest of the house fell to a minimum. 

By the time May first came, there was no sign of her moving out. And when Matt attempted to evict her, Sarah called the Department of Fair employment and housing claiming discrimination against her religion and her disabilities. While the state didn't follow through on these threats, they did discover that Matt had never filed the correct paperwork to house tenants, and Matt couldn't evict her until the proper paperwork was filed, but the strangest event would happen that summer. 

In July, Sarah gathered 12 members of her sole bonding group at the house to perform a ritual, threatening Matt that she would file a discrimination suit against him if he wouldn't let them stay. Though Matt he only allowed them to stay until 10:00 that night. One roommate demanded that the soul bonders be ejected, but Matt wanted to gawk at their ritual, and so they stood in the kitchen and ate pizza while watching them. He describes the ritual.

Quote, 
> Sara came downstairs dressed in a white dress. She kept glancing at us. Something stood between her and us, so she couldn't see us, I guess. And she began talking. She talked about how this was Betty's awakening and how Betty was now going to finally realize her potential by harnessing the soul of a video game character. I couldn't stand it. I started cracking up the rest of the Housemates started cracking up. This was better than any kind of TV you can imagine. See if you can picture all of these nut jobs dealing around the alter as the video game played its music in the background. Sarah stood over them preaching this religion and the right bishop something, but occasionally interject something deep from her position. Sarah was really getting upset, so more of her friends made the human wall We could still hear all the stupid, even after they turned up the volume on that video game. At this point, Matt threatened to call the police since it was nearly 10:00. But when one of the members of Sarah's group through a punch, the threat was carried out and the group was forced from the premises. 

After this point, other members of the house would share some of their experiences. But as they did, readers grew more suspicious. Before this, many people had been doubting the veracity of the claims made by Pete. But when the other housemates began to write in a similar fashion to him, it made them even more dubious. These disagreements eventually spiraled into arguments whose full scope was not archived before being deleted, but they were apparently severe enough for the moderator of Housemate Hor to write a post regarding them. 

Also in this post was a surprising and unexpected piece of information, quote, 

> Tim, Pete and Cary, aka the people posting from the account DragonTigerClaw about the Sarah Saga. Maybe as they say they are, different housemates of Sara, or they may be the 1 person doing a little creative writing experiment. Basically, I don't give a crap. The posts have been amusing and entertaining and anyone who doesn't think so is not being forced to read them, so please do not complain. 

Further down, the mod continues. 

>It has been brought to my attention that post was made by someone who was claiming to know Sarah and that the posts made by DTC were false and harassing blah blah blah blah. This same person Jay Eckhart sent me an email before they made that post requesting IP address information on the poster of the Sarah Stories in order to catch the culprit making these false and harassing posts. I declined as I do not think giving out personalidentifying information such as IP addresses on members of my community without their permission is really a good thing to do to you? Also, I have no proof that this person is really representing Sarah or that the posts made about her are false. I have no proof that they are true either, but until I get proof either way, I think the best thing is to not take any drastic actions. They requested I not tell DTC about them contact me and I intended not to simply because it was the most neutral action to take, but then they made that post and made their intentions public. So I feel fine with telling you all, including DTC about the email now. 

But meanwhile, elsewhere on the Internet, other people were having their own discussion about the Sara Saga, and they would quickly discover much more than they first expected. 

On 08/19/2008, a member of the Something awful forums named Jabber Walk posted a thread entitled, if you thought furries were bad, which linked to the 11 parts of the Sara Saga that had been posted so far. The responses seemed mostly to reflect amusement, though quite a number of forum members echoed the doubt displayed in the comments of the posts themselves. One user, however, who went by Jaeger, had a different response. 

>I haven't read through the journals. I only started the first, but I swear this could be about a girl I knew and even once dated in that really vague, sad, high school nerd way. She claimed that she was soul bonded to the Arris character from Final Fantasy 7, that her girlfriend was soul bonded to Sephiroth, and she swore at one point with perfect seriousness that she was carrying Sephiroth's spirit child. Apparently, she'd conducted an elaborate fantasy life with these character in her head and had written pages upon pages of god awful fan fiction about it. So far as I know, she grew out of it eventually when I say eventually, I mean like late twenties. Even when I knew her at 16, this kind of behavior from her made me want to stay far the fuck away. Oh yeah, the girl in question also changed her name to some bullshit nerd fantasy name she made up and absolutely refused to ever be addressed by her birth name. 

After reading through the rest of the entries, Jaeger returned the next day with a new post that took the other readers aback. 

> Pretty sure I've got this all sewn up goons. Allow me to introduce you to Katherine Rain. 

By pure chance, Jaeger Hoona had been in a small writing club in high school with Katherine and still knew her flicker account, her deviantart account, and her live journal account. They also discovered the flicker account of someone caused playing Azerai, who had numerous pictures of both herself and Catherine, one of these images credited her as Catherine Silberberg, Silberberg being the surname of a family of characters from Suikoden known for their tactical prowess in war, other photographs had Katherine in a white dress, something that Sara had worn in the Sarasaga. 

But the most telling piece of evidence the Jaeger Hounded discovered was legal paperwork of her name change. By searching for her name in the county archives he was able to discover her court schedule for when she legally changed her name. Though the accounts of Pete and his housemates were still doubted, the identity of Sarah seemed almost certain.

They also were able to track down the website that this soul bonding community was using to proselitize curious Internet users. Another person rediscovered the pamphlets that they would hand out at conventions. 

Part of it reads, 
> the Runes are devoted to preserving the natural order of life. While it can't be denied that their bearers have often experienced great hardship as a result of bearing the wounds, we know that this is due to inexperienced bearers with no magical training, suddenly and unexpectedly receiving the Runes' gifts. With no knowledge of how to live in harmony with these powerful entities, they can't control the vast forces raging in turmoil inside themselves. But if people were taught to listen to understand the ruins, we could have the healthy, positive relationships with them that we were always meant to have. 

The end of the pamphlet encourages readers to contact Bishop Sessahrei. After looking through the information on the final fantasy house, Jaeger made another assertion that Katherine had also been deeply involved with Jen and Hojo. He believed that she was in fact, both CandyWrapper, the person who had written the list on the website, as well as Arris, the apprentice that Jen had lost. 

Catherine had also been attending the University of Delaware during the events of the final fantasy house, only a two hour drive from State College. It appeared that after these two distanced themselves from one another, Katherine began her own soul bonding community based on the Sweet Good End Games gathering followers over the years. The evidence linking the two was circumstantial, the specificity of it left little doubt. And this revived interest in the final fantasy house enough that new people were again discovering it. 

On August 20 second, Just 2 days after Jaeger had posted about Katherine, he made another post saying, quote, 

> took a day off everyone. I don't really have anything more to add. Except to mention to everyone that I've become aware that our protagonist is now aware of this thread. Say hi, everyone. 

Leafily, the rest of the forum members began to post messages to Katherine, mocking and teasing her, claiming to be soul bonded to any number of characters or objects. That same day however, an update was posted to the final Fantasy House website. 

Quote, 
> I updated some stuff to make it slightly more legible. Evidently, Housemate horrors, Sara is not Ring Crystal. This comes to me via the writer of the Sarah Saga. If you think he's lying or that I'm lying, that is your own business, but that is what he told me. Rain crystal's behavior, soul bond nuttiness, getting money for it, etcetera, is similar enough to Sarah that she is harassing the writer to stop posting his lies about her. As such, I still think she's worth warning people about. I am sorry, but based on my experiences and the experiences of others, Soul bonders are dangerous freakos.

The next day, Jaeger had a strongly worded reply. 

> This is actually a goddamn lie. Greta is a litigious loving nut and it sounds to me like housemate horror dude is doing damage control. I don't blame the final fantasy 7 house author since he's probably taking it simply on faith that our housemate horror author is telling the truth. But he's not, and anybody who's read this far through the thread should see through this pathetic obfuscation pretty easily. 

In response to one person asking for clarification, Jaeger replied, 
> it would be irresponsible for me to say that Greta and her friends have their collective panties in a wad about the housemate horror thing and have been pressuring the author to recant so I won't. I'd like to add that it's possible that the Housemate horror author is a very elaborate troll. But even if he is, this is clearly someone who knows Greta if it's her of course. And while I'm willing to entertain the idea that some of the particulars might be fabricated, the fact that anybody you know like maybe Greta, has possibly gotten so defensive about a series of stories, which even use false names, says much about that person. 

Finally, on August 20 fourth, in mid afternoon, all parts of the story were removed from the Housemate horror blog. However, Working from Google Cache, the members of the forum were able to piece together all of the parts that had been written by DragonTigerClaw and archiving it on the forum, though it also had been saved on the way back machine. 

That same day, the original final fantasy house author posted an update to his website, quote, 

> Well, what do you know? When something awful found Catherine Rain, things really heated up. The original writer of the Sarasaga got regular harassment until he took the story down. Considering the mind numbing level of consistent details between Katherine's data and the data on Sarah, I'm going to agree with the goons. The o p was just doing damage control. It's obviously her. The current theory is, in one last ditch effort to avoid more core battles with her, he deleted all the posts. Well Greta, you stepped in it. You took away my train wreck that I was reading to defend your crazy cult. If he was writing fiction or not, You took away the fun. Thanks to something awful. We'll have lots of nice photos and links all hear about you in just a little while. 

This last update remains on the website to this day and a link to the Sarasaga threat on something awful is provided farther down the page. 

Now, the final fantasy house's website and the Sarasaga remain as a warning about fans taken to their extreme, but they also service an example of how the online space collapses the distances between people so that even old friends with no more existing ties can discover or stumble across one another, with wildly unpredictable effects.
