# Number seven

> Now, I'm going to test your numerology skills by asking you to think about the magic seven, okay? Most of you will know that seven is quite a number in all sorts of themes, religions. And I'm sure that you can compress numbers as well. So if we think about 2014, all right, I'm just giving you 2014, you drop the zero, 14, two times **7**. Okay, that's just by way of example, and we're going to carry on. (Laughter) So 2014 will be a milestone and hopefully a magic year in many respects. It will mark the hundredth anniversary of the First World War back in 1914. It will note the **7**0th anniversary, drop the zero, seven-- of the Breton Woods conference that actually gave birth to the IMF. And it will be the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 25th, okay. It will also mark the seventh anniversary of the financial market jitters that quickly turned into the greatest global economic calamity since the Great Depression. *Transcript, National Press Club Luncheon with Christine Lagarde, WEdnesday, January 15, 2014*

2014 = 14/2 = **7**
2014 = 2+0+1+4 = **7**

2023 = 2+0+2+3 = **7**
