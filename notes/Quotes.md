“By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs.”
― Donna Haraway

“It matters what matters we use to think other matters with; it matters what stories we tell to tell other stories with; it matters what knots knot knots, what thoughts think thoughts, what descriptions describe descriptions, what ties tie ties. It matters what stories make worlds, what worlds make stories.”
― Donna J. Haraway, Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene [[The Secrets of the Wood Wide Web]]

“Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other.”
― Donna Haraway

“From this point of view, science - the real game in town - is rhetoric, a series of efforts to persuade relevant social actors that one's manufactured knowledge is a route to a desired form of very objective power.”
― Donna Haraway

“The cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity.”
― Donna J. Haraway

“Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary of holism, but needy for connection- they seem to have a natural feel for united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins.”
― Donna J. Haraway

“Consciousness of exclusion through naming is acute. Identities seem contradictory, partial, and strategic.”
― Donna Haraway

“For salamanders, regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury. The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been injured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender”
― Donna Haraway

“Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.”
― Donna J. Haraway

“The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code.”
― Donna Haraway, Simians, Cyborgs And Women The Reinvention Of Nature

“The [[Anthropocene]] marks severe discontinuities; what comes after will not be like what came before. I think our job is to make the [[Anthropocene]] as short/thin as possible and to cultivate with each other in every way imaginable epochs to come that can replenish refuge. (100)”
― Donna J. Haraway, Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene

“Possesion - property - is about reciprocity and rights of access. If I have a dog, my dog has a human.”
― Donna Haraway

“Our bodies, with the old genetic transmission, have not kept pace with the new language-produced cultural transmission of technology. So now, when social control breaks down, we must expect to see pathological destruction.”
― Donna J. Haraway, Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature

Quando la vita ti da limoni, non fateci una limonata. 
Restitute alla vita i limoni! 
Incazzatev! 
Dite alla vita:
"Non voglio i tuoi fottuti limoni! Che cazzo dovrei farci con questi?"

Pretendete di vedere il manager della vita! 
Fate si che la vita rimpianga il fottuto e miserabile giorno in cui ha pensato di darvi dei limoni! 

"Tu sai chi sono io? 
Sono l’uomo che brucerà la tua casa! 
Con i limoni! 
Metterò degli scienzati ad inventare un limone combustibile 
che bruci la tua casa!"
